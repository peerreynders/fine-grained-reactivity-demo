**Note**: The second `package.json` in this folder is necessary to allow ESLint to run in the [comfort of a CommonJS environment](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12319#issuecomment-535799024) while the ECMAScript code can run in an [ESM environment](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_package_json_and_file_extensions) (`"type": "module",`).

## General Idea
* `internal.d.ts` - [Declaration file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) with type definitions in TypeScript that are complex or have to be shared among various ECMAScript implementation files.
* `reactivity.js` - An ECMAScript implementation file. Types that are local **and** [representable with JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) don't have to be in `internal.d.ts`. Otherwise types are [imported](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#import-types) from `internal.d.ts`.
* `reactivity.d.ts` - [Declaration file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) with the types necessary to expose the public API of the ECMAScript implementation file to TypeScript (strictly speaking a single declaration file could cover multiple implementing ECMAScript modules via [ambient modules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#ambient-modules)).
* `reactivity.test.js` - Given that the objective is to remove TypeScript as a compilation step (and use it occasionally as a "type linter" instead) test files cannot use TypeScript but must use ECMAScript instead.
